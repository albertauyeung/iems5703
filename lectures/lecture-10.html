# Scalability of Network Applications

- What does **scalable** mean? We need to understand what is **scalability** before we can build something that is scalable.
- Is **scalable** the same as:
    - High availability (always available to the users)?
    - High performance (handle every request very quickly)?
    - Cost effective (low cost to build a system that serves many users)?

---

# Scalability

### Why should online services be scalable?

- Consider what would happen when a lot of users are browsing your website, using your app, or accessing your APIs
- Growth in **traffic** and **data**
- Our objectives:
    - To keep the service **available**
    - To keep the **performance** of the system at a certain level
    - To keep it **cost-effective** to operate the service

---

# Scalability

## Consider the following systems:

- Common client-server system with a **database**
- Clients are distributed **geo-graphically**
- Different **types** of clients (e.g. Web, mobile, API)
- Different **kinds** of requests (e.g. retrieval, data submission, image uploading, file editing, video encoding…)
- Different kinds of **data** (e.g. relational data, text, images, videos…)
- ...

---

# Scalability

### Scalability does **NOT** only mean:

- Improving your codes
- Using a more powerful machine
- Adding more RAMs

### Scalability is about

- Identifying and mitigating bottlenecks
- Considering the whole architecture of the system in order to engineer a solution

---

# Scalability

### Scalability is **NOT** equal to

- Performance
- Choosing a particular operating system
- Choosing a particular programming language
- Choosing a particular storage technology

---

# Scalability - Related Concepts

### High Availability (HA)

- A system is **highly available** if it is operational for most of the time in a specific period (e.g. a year)
- For example, if a service has 99.9% availability, it is expected that the service will be operational for 24 x 365 x 0.999 = 8751.24 hours in a year (also known as **up time**)
- **Principles** of HA: eliminate single points of failure, avoid data loss in case of failure, and detection of failures as they occur
- A highly available system will be a distributed one, hence usually scalable

---

# Scalability - Related Concepts

### System Performance

- How efficient is the system in performing a task given certain amount of computing resources (CPU time, memory, etc.)
- Using a language that executes code faster at runtime
- Using a faster sorting algorithm
- Optimizing your SQL query to shorten the time to retrieve data from the database
- ...

# Scalability - Definition

### Two common definitions/views of "scalability":

1. Scalability is the ability to handle increased workload<br/>(without adding resources to a system)<br/><br/>
2. Scalability is the ability to handle increased workload by repeatedly applying a cost-effective strategy for extending a system’s capacity

<br/><br/>
Reference: Charles et al., 2006. On System Scalability.<br>[http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=7887](http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=7887)

---

# Scalability - Definition

### The first definition is of less interest to us in this course

- It does NOT focus on whether the system can be improved / extended when the workload increases
- It focus on whether the system has good performance on a large problem, not on how the system can be scaled

### Instead, we are more interested in the second definition, in particular:

- **"repeatedly applying a cost-effective strategy"** to extend the system’s capacity

---

# Scalability - Definition

### "Repeatedly applying a cost-effective strategy"

- We are NOT interested in **one-time increase** in capacity, such as:
    - replacing a O(n2) algorithm with an O(n log n) one
    - coding in a language which produces programs that run faster<br/><br/>
- We are NOT interested in solutions that requires **a relatively high cost**, such as:
    - replacing a 4-core CPU within a 16-core CPU
    - building a super-computer using advanced HPC technologies

---

# Horizontal vs. Vertical

### Vertical scaling – also known as **"scale UP"**

- Add resources to a single node in a system
- E.g. adding CPU or RAMs, increasing the disk size of a DB server, etc.

### Horizontal scaling – also known as **"scale OUT"**

- Add more nodes to a system
- Systems are designed to be distributed
- E.g. adding more servers to a cluster of computers

---

# Scaling Out

### In order to achieve scalability, we usually aim to build a system that can easily scale-out (horizontally)

- Allow distributing workload easily
- If you scale-up, you will quickly reach a **limit** (either technically or financially)
- Trade-off: you need something to **manage** your large number of nodes

---

# Scaling Out

- Have you ever imagined how many servers are supporting **Google** or **Facebook**?
- Let's take a look at Facebook's report of [Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/facebook-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300591468.html):

---

# 1. Horizontal Duplication

- When the **read-to-write ratio** of your database is high (e.g. 5:1): 
    - For many applications, the database is read much more frequently than is written to
    - Consider how often your post a new status on Facebook vs. how often you read your news feed
    - Simple way to scale: have multiple **read-only** database to handle the many read requests

# 2. Split by Functions

### Scaling through distribution based on the **separation of distinct / different functions** (verbs) and **data** (nouns)<br/><br/>

### By functions (verbs)
- Registration

.column-right[
### By data (nouns)
- User profiles
- Items for sale
- Product catalogues
- Images
]

---

# 3. Split by Storage

- Also known as **sharding** - take a data set and partition it into multiple parts based on some rules
- Consider an online services that serves multiple enterprise users (each company has an account and data are not supposed to be seen by another company)
    - You are not going to combine data from different companies in any function
    - You can have dedicated servers storing data for each company

# Summary

### The keys to build scalable systems are

- Identifying **bottlenecks** of the system<br/><br/>
- **Horizontal duplication**: allow scaling to be done quickly<br/><br/>
- **De-coupling**: let loosely-coupled modules interact through simple and well-defined interfaces

# Load Balancing

### Different ways to implement a load balancer

- DNS / Hardware / Software
- Implement it on different networking layers
- Algorithms: random / Round-robin / dynamic scheduling

---

# Load Balancing Algorithms

- **Random**
- **Round-Robin**
    - Distribute load equally by using a rotating scheme
- **Weighted Round-Robin**
    - A performance weight is assigned to each server
- **Least Connections**
    - Sends requests to a server with the fewest number of connections
- **Fastest Response Time**
    - Select the server that responded in the shortest time

---

# Server Health Checking

- A load balancer might need to check whether the servers are operating normally and are able to give responses.
- How can we check if one of the servers has died?
    1. **Passive**: **Observe** the **network traffic**
    2. **Active**: **Probe** the server for a **quick response**
- What are the pros and cons of these two?
- How can health checking be done?

---

# Server Health Checking

- **Ping**
    - Send an ICMP message to the server and check for response
- **TCP Connection**
    - Attempt to establish a TCP connection to the server (on port 80)
- **HTTP GET (Header)**
    - Check the status code of a GET request
- **HTTP GET (Content)**
    Check the content returned by the server for a GET request<br/><br/>
- **Question**: What are the limitations of the first three methods?

---

# DNS

- DNS stands for **Domain Name System**
- A **directory service** of the Internet

<center>
    <img src="img/l10-dns-intro.png" width="90%">
</center>

---

# DNS Load Balancing

### A simple way of implementing load balancing

- Create two or more **“A” records** in the DNS zone
- The DNS server sends the client a list of records in **random order** or in a round-robin fashion
- The client attempts to connect to the application server using the **first IP address** in the list

---

# DNS Load Balancing 

### What are “A” records?

- Address record: mapping a domain name to an IPv4 address

### Other records:

- AAAA: domain name to IPv6 address
- CNAME: alias of a domain name
- MX: mail exchange (identifies the mail server of the domain)
- NS: name server record

# DNS Load Balancing

### Simple, but a few limitations:

- **Stickiness**: It takes time to propagate changes in DNS records  adding or removing servers can be slow
- Loading can NOT be balanced accurately due to **DNS caching** (e.g. when a lot of users are from the same ISP)
- It does NOT take into account transaction time, server load, network congestions, etc.
- NO **fault tolerance** (DNS server does not know if a server is operating or not)

# Hardware / Software Load Balancing

- Load balancing can be done at the different layers

### OSI model Layer 4 (Transport Layer) Load Balancing

- Relatively simple
- Balancing server load without inspecting the content of messages
- Distribute traffic based on servers’ response time
- Routing is based on inspecting the first packet of the data stream

---

# Layer 4 Load Balancing

### What are the advantages of Layer 4 Load Balancing?

- Simple: easy to implement
- Efficient: load balancer only inspect the first packet However

### However

- It cannot maintain application session information
- It cannot route requests to different servers based on their content (e.g. requesting static content vs. dynamic content)

---

# Layer 7 Load Balancing

### Layer 7 (Application Layer) Load Balancing

- **Application-level** load balancing
- Parse requests in the **application layer** (e.g. HTTP), and distribute them to servers **based on the content** of the request (e.g. the URL or the cookie)
- Relatively **high overhead** in parsing the metadata
- Mostly **HTTP** (because of the popularity of Web apps)

---

# Layer 7 Load Balancing

### Characteristics of Layer 7 Load Balancing

- More CPU-intensive (e.g. for parsing HTTP content)
- Can also apply compression, encryption or caching on the content to be delivered
- Does not require all servers in the backend to have serve the same content (compare with Layer 4 load balancing) Layer 7 load balancers are also called **Application Delivery Controllers**

---

# Layer 7 Load Balancing

- One important ability of a layer 7 load balancer is **SSL termination**
- The load balancer has to be able to decrypt the request in order to **inspect the content**
- It therefore must be configured with **a valid SSL certificate**

# Building UI in Python

# Curses

- `curses` is a module in the standard library for controlling **text mode** displays<br/>(for Linux and Mac only; try [http://effbot.org/zone/console-index.htm](Console) if on Windows)
- It allows you to **display** texts on the screen and also handle **keyboard inputs**
- A tutorial of `curses`: [https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html)
- **Example**: displaying the string `Hello` on line 3 starting at the 10th column

```python
from curses import wrapper

def main(stdscr):
    stdscr.clear()                 # Clear everything on the screen
    stdscr.addstr(3, 10, 'Hello')  # Print 'Hello' on line 3, column 10
    stdscr.refresh()               # Refresh the screen
    stdscr.getkey()                # Wait for user input

wrapper(main)
```

---

class: split

# Handle User Inputs

.column-left[
```python
def main(stdscr):
    y, x = 5, 20  # initial position of the string
    while True:
        stdscr.clear()
        stdscr.addstr(y, x, "Hello")
        c = stdscr.getch()
        if c == curses.KEY_UP:
            y = max(0, y - 1)
        elif c == curses.KEY_DOWN:
            y = min(y + 1, curses.LINES - 1)
        elif c == curses.KEY_LEFT:
            x = max(0, x - 1)
        elif c == curses.KEY_RIGHT:
            x = min(x + 1, curses.COLS - 1)
```
]
.column-right[
- `getch()` returns an integer, which is **ASCII code** of the key pressed
- `getkey()` returns a string, such as `p` and `KEY_UP`
- **Example**: print the string in a new location based on key pressed
]

---

# Multi-threading

- For network applications that want to use `curses` to implement the UI, multi-threading has to be used.
- One thread should handle input and output with `curses` (a **UI thread**), while other threads are used to handle network communications
- Use a **queue** or a **pipe** to enable communication between different threads
- Example: [curses_threading_01.py](files/curses_threading_01.py)

# GUI Programming with Tkinter

- [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/tkinter.html) (stands for "Tk interface") is the standard Python interface to the [Tk GUI toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk_(software))
- Available on most Unix platforms and Windows systems
- Use the following command to check it `tkinter` is properly installed on your system:

```bash
$ python3 -m tkinter
```

- If it is properly installed, you will see a window opened with two buttons inside.
- Note: there are other libraries for GUI programming in Python, check the following link:<br/> [https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming)

---

# GUI Example

- The following exmaple will display a window with a **text box**, with two lines of text in it

```python
import tkinter

# Create the main window of the application
root = tkinter.Tk()

# Create a text box which is added to the main window (its container)
text = tkinter.Text(root, height=20, width=100)

# Control where the text box should appear in the main window
text.pack()

# Insert some text into the text box
text.insert(tkinter.END, "Line 1\nLine 2\n")

# Starts the event loop of the GUI
tkinter.mainloop()
```

---

# GUI Example 2

```python
class Application(tkinter.Frame):
    def __init__(self, master=None):
        super().__init__(master)
        self.pack()
        self.create_widgets()

    def create_widgets(self):
        self.hi_there = tkinter.Button(self, text="Click Me", command=self.say_hi)
        self.hi_there.pack(side="top")
        self.quit = tkinter.Button(self, text="QUIT", command=root.destroy)
        self.quit.pack(side="bottom")

    def say_hi(self):
        print("hi there, everyone!")

app = Application(master=tkinter.Tk())
app.mainloop()
```

---

# Multi-threading with GUI

- The `mainloop()` function starts an **event loop** for the GUI, it only takes care of things related to the user interface
- **Avoid** doing tasks that take a long time to run (e.g. anything longer than 500ms), otherwise the user cannot interact with the UI properly
- If you have any networking or file I/O operation, do it in **another thread**
- Use a **queue** to exchange data whenever possible
- You should always run the GUI event loop in the **main thread**
- Example: [gui_multithreading.py](files/gui_multithreading.py)
