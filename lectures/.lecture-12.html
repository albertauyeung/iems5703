# XML-RPC

• Remote Procedure Call
• Uses HTTP as a transport protocol
• Parameters/Results encoded in XML
• Supported by languages other than Python

How to create a stand-alone server
21
from SimpleXMLRPCServer import SimpleXMLRPCServer
def add(x,y):
return x+y
s = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("",8080))
s.register_function(add)
s.serve_forever()
• How to test it (xmlrpclib)
>>> import xmlrpclib
>>> s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://localhost:8080")
>>> s.add(3,5)
8
>>> s.add("Hello","World")
"HelloWorld"
>>>


Adding multiple functions
22
from SimpleXMLRPCServer import SimpleXMLRPCServer
s = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("",8080))
s.register_function(add)
s.register_function(foo)
s.register_function(bar)
s.serve_forever()
• Registering an instance (exposes all methods)
from SimpleXMLRPCServer import SimpleXMLRPCServer
s = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("",8080))
obj = SomeObject()
s.register_instance(obj)
s.serve_forever()


XML-RPC is extremely easy to use
• Almost too easy--you might get the perception
that it's extremely limited or fragile
• I have encountered a lot of major projects that
are using XML-RPC for distributed control
• Users seem to love it (I concur)

One wart of caution...
• XML-RPC assumes all strings are UTF-8
encoded Unicode
• Consequence: You can't shove a string of raw
binary data through an XML-RPC call
• For binary: must base64 encode/decode
• base64 module can be used for this

# Serializing Python Objects

Serializing Python Objects
26
• In distributed applications, you may want to
pass various kinds of Python objects around
(e.g., lists, dicts, sets, instances, etc.)
• Libraries such as XML-RPC support simple
data types, but not anything more complex
• However, serializing arbitrary Python objects
into byte-strings is quite simple


A module for serializing objects
27
• Serializing an object onto a "file"
import pickle
...
pickle.dump(someobj,f)
• Unserializing an object from a file
someobj = pickle.load(f)
• Here, a file might be a file, a pipe, a wrapper
around a socket, etc.


Pickle can also turn objects into byte strings
import pickle
# Convert to a string
s = pickle.dumps(someobj, protocol)
...
# Load from a string
someobj = pickle.loads(s)
• This can be used if you need to embed a
Python object into some other messaging
protocol or data encoding



Using pickle with XML-RPC
# addserv.py
import pickle
def add(px,py):
x = pickle.loads(px)
y = pickle.loads(py)
return pickle.dumps(x+y)
from SimpleXMLRPCServer import SimpleXMLRPCServer
serv = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("",15000))
serv.register_function(add)
serv.serve_forever()
29
• Notice: All input arguments and return values
are encoded/decoded with pickle


Passing Python objects from the client
>>> import pickle
>>> import xmlrpclib
>>> serv = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://localhost:15000")
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> b = [4,5]
>>> r = serv.add(pickle.dumps(a),pickle.dumps(b))
>>> c = pickle.loads(r)
>>> c
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>>
30
• Again, all input and return values are processed
through pickle


Pickle is really only useful if used in a Pythononly
environment
• Would not use if you need to communicate
to other programming languages
• There are also security concerns
• Never use pickle with untrusted clients
(malformed pickles can be used to execute
arbitrary system commands)

Sending Python Objects over Network

multiprocessing
• Python 2.6/3.0 include a new library module
(multiprocessing) that can be used for
different forms of distributed computation
• It is a substantial module that also addresses
interprocess communication, parallel
computing, worker pools, etc.
• Will only show a few network features here


Creating a dedicated connection between
two Python interpreter processes
• Listener (server) process
34
from multiprocessing.connection import Listener
serv = Listener(("",16000),authkey="12345")
c = serv.accept()
• Client process
from multiprocessing.connection import Client
c = Client(("servername",16000),authkey="12345")
• On surface, looks similar to a TCP connection

Connections allow bidirectional message
passing of arbitrary Python objects
35
c
c.send(obj) obj = c.recv()
• Underneath the covers, everything routes
through the pickle module
• Similar to a network connection except that
you just pass objects through it


Example server using multiprocessing
# addserv.py
def add(x,y):
return x+y
from multiprocessing.connection import Listener
serv = Listener(("",16000),authkey="12345")
c = serv.accept()
while True:
x,y = c.recv() # Receive a pair
c.send(add(x,y)) # Send result of add(x,y)
36
• Note: Omitting a variety of error checking/
exception handling


Client connection with multiprocessing
>>> from multiprocessing.connection import Client
>>> client = Client(("",16000),authkey="12345")
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> b = [4,5]
>>> client.send((a,b))
>>> c = client.recv()
>>> c
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>>
37
• Even though pickle is being used underneath
the covers, you don't see it here

Multiprocessing module already does the
work related to pickling, error handling, etc.
• Can use it as the foundation for something
more advanced
• There are many more features of
multiprocessing not shown here (e.g.,
features related to distributed objects,
parallel processing, etc.)



Multiprocessing is a good choice if you're
working strictly in a Python environment
• It will be faster than XML-RPC
• It has some security features (authkey)
• More flexible support for passing Python
objects around

Allowing Multithreaded Read Access While Maintaining a Write Lock

Credit: Sami Hangaslammi
Problem

You need to allow unlimited read access to a resource when it is not being modified while keeping write access exclusive.
Solution

“One-writer, many-readers” locks are a frequent necessity, and Python does not supply them directly. As usual, they’re not hard to program yourself, in terms of other synchronization primitives that Python does supply:

import threading

class ReadWriteLock:
    """ A lock object that allows many simultaneous "read locks", but
    only one "write lock." """

    def _ _init_ _(self):
        self._read_ready = threading.Condition(threading.Lock(  ))
        self._readers = 0

    def acquire_read(self):
        """ Acquire a read lock. Blocks only if a thread has
        acquired the write lock. """
        self._read_ready.acquire(  )
        try:
            self._readers += 1
        finally:
            self._read_ready.release(  )

    def release_read(self):
        """ Release a read lock. """
        self._read_ready.acquire(  )
        try:
            self._readers -= 1
            if not self._readers:
                self._read_ready.notifyAll(  )
        finally:
            self._read_ready.release(  )

    def acquire_write(self):
        """ Acquire a write lock. Blocks until there are no
        acquired read or write locks. """
        self._read_ready.acquire(  )
        while self._readers > 0:
            self._read_ready.wait(  )

    def release_write(self):
        """ Release a write lock. """
        self._read_ready.release(  )

Discussion

It is often convenient to allow unlimited read access to a resource when it is not being modified and still keep write access exclusive. While the threading module does not contain a specific class for the job, the idiom is easy to implement using a Condition object, and this recipe shows how you can do that.

An instance of the ReadWriteLock class is initialized without arguments, as in:

rw = ReadWriteLock(  )

Internally, rw._readers counts the number of readers who are currently in the read-write lock (initially zero). The actual synchronization is performed by a threading.Condition object (created at _ _init_ _ around a new Lock object and held in rw._read_ready).

The acquire_read and release_read methods increment and decrement the number of active readers. Of course, this happens between acquire and release calls to _read_ready—such bracketing is obviously necessary even to avoid race conditions between different threads wanting to acquire or release a read lock. But we also exploit _read_ready for another purpose, which is why release_read also does a notifyAll on it, if and when it notices it has removed the last read lock.

The notifyAll method of a Condition object wakes up all threads (if any) that are on a wait condition on the object. In this recipe, the only way a thread can get into such a wait is via the acquire_write method, when it finds there are readers active after acquiring _read_ready. The wait call on the Condition object releases the underlying lock, so release_read methods can execute, but reacquires it again before waking up, so acquire_write can safely keep checking whenever it wakes up, if it’s finally in a no-readers-active situation. When that happens, acquire_write returns to its caller, but keeps the lock, so no other writer or reader can enter again, until the writer calls release_write, which lets the lock go again.

Note that this recipe offers no guarantee against what is technically known as a starvation situation. In other words, there is no guarantee that a writer won’t be kept waiting indefinitely by a steady stream of readers arriving, even if no reader keeps its read lock for very long. If this is a problem in your specific application, you can avoid starvation by adding complications to ensure that new readers don’t enter their lock if they notice that a writer is waiting. However, in many cases, you can count on situations in which no readers are holding read locks, without special precautions to ensure that such situations occur. In such cases, this recipe is directly applicable, and besides eschewing complications, it avoids potentially penalizing reader performance by making several readers wait for one pending writer.

# Multi-casting


IP Address
0.0.0.0/4

subnet mask: 


classed networks
8-bit: Class A
16-bit: Class B
24-bit: Class C

subnet mask separates network address from host address
<Network> <host>

e.g. 
/4:
11110000 00000000 00000000 00000000
----
^ network



IP Multicasting
a method of sending Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams to a group of interested receivers in a single transmission. It is a form of point-to-multipoint communication employed for streaming media and other applications on the Internet and private networks.
(described in RFC 1112)

common transport layer protocol to use multicast addressing is UDP

By design, UDP is not reliable

reliable multicast protocols? (Pragmatic General Multicast)


Key concepts:
IP multicast group address
multicast distribution tree
receiver driver tree creation

in IPv4, multicast addresses are defined by the leading address bts of 1110 (starting from 1110 0000 = 224 to 1110 1111 = 239)
