Last update: 2018-01-27 (More details and materials will come soon)

## Overview

- **Proposal Submission Deadline**: 10th March, 2018 (Saturday)
- **Final Submission Deadline**: 30th April, 2018 (Monday)
- **25%** of the final grade

## Basic requirement

In this project, you will have to design and implement a **network application**, which allows multiple users to use it for some purposes. Your application should fulfil the following requirements:

- It has to be implemented in Python 3
- It has to use the client-server architecture, i.e. there will be a server program and a client program
- It must use some forms of network programming (e.g. TCP, UDP, HTTP, Websockets)
- It should use some forms of concurrent programming (it is OK if you use some frameworks that already use threading, multiprocessing or asynchronous tasks under the surface)

## Proposal

You should submit a 1 page proposal in PDF by 10th March, 2018 by sending a email to me, describing the application that you will develop in the project.

## Submission

You should submit the following

- All source codes, must include the server and client programs
- A read me file with instructions on how to run your programs
- A report in PDF (no more than 10 A4 pages) describing what you have done
    - What problem does your application solves
    - What networking technology do you use in the development
    - What libraries or modules do you use to facilitate the development
    - How will you improve it if you have more time?
